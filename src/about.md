Hello, my name is Victoria Kuc and I am an artist living in Staffordshire, UK.

I am surrounded by the beautiful English countryside, my two dogs and three cats
which inspire me to make realistic sculptures using clay and paint wonderful
watercolours.

You can find some of my work on [Instagram]({{ social.instagram }}),
[Twitter]({{ social.twitter }}) and [Etsy]({{ social.etsy }}).

If you would like a commission, [please get in touch](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
